# Migrating from 0.8 to 0.9

First off, Temple now requires Elixir 1.13 or higher. This is because of some changes that were brought to the Elixir parser.

## Whitespace Control

To control whitespace in an element, Temple will now control this based on whether the `do` was used in the keyword list syntax or the do/end syntax.

In 0.8, you would do:

```elixir
span do
  "hello!"
end

# <span>
#   hello!
# </span>

# The ! version of the element would render it as "tight"
span! do
  "hello!"
end

# <span>hello!</span>
```

In 0.9, you would do:

```elixir
span do
  "hello!"
end

# <span>
#   hello!
# </span>

span do: "hello!"

# <span>hello!</span>
```

## Components

Components are no longer module based. To render a component, you can pass a function reference to the `c` keyword. You also no longer need to define a component in a module, using the `Temple.Component` module and its `render` macro.

In 0.8, you would define a component like:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Component.Card do
  import Temple.Component

  render do
    div class: "border p-4 rounded" do
      slot :default
    end
  end
end
```

And you would use the component like:

```elixir
div do
  c MyAppWeb.Component.Card do
    "Welcome to my app!"
  end
end
```

In 0.9, you would define a component like:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Components do
  import Temple

  def card(assigns) do
    temple do
      div class: "border p-4 rounded" do
        slot :default
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And you would use the component like:

```elixir
div do
  c &MyAppWeb.Components.card/1 do
    "Welcome to my app!"
  end
end
```

We can observe here that in 0.9 the component is just any 1-arity function, so you can define them anywhere and you can have more than 1 in a single module.

### defcomp

Now that components are just functions, you no longer need this special macro to define a component in the middle of the module.

This can simply be converted to a function.

## Phoenix

All Phoenix related items have moved to the [temple_phoenix](https://github.com/mhanberg/temple_phoenix) package. Please see those library docs for more details.
