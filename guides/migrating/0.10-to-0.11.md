# Migrating from 0.10 to 0.11

Most of the changes in this release are related to tweaking Temple's component model to align with HEEx & Surface.

## Rendering Slots

Slots are now available as assigns in the component and are rendered as such.

### Before

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    span do
      slot :a_slot
    end
  end
end
```

### After

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    span do
      slot @a_slot
    end
  end
end
```

## :default slot has been renamed to :inner_block

The main body of a component has been renamed from `:default` to `:inner_block`.

Note: The "after" example also includes the necessary change specified above.

### Before

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    span do
      slot :default
    end
  end
end
```

### After

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    span do
      slot @inner_block
    end
  end
end
```

## Passing data into slots

The syntax for capturing data being passed from the call site of a slot to the definition of a slot (or put another way, from the definition of a component to the call site of the component) has changed. 

You now capture it as the value of the `:let` attribute on the slot definition.

### Before

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    c &my_component/1 do
      slot :a_slot, %{some: value} do
        "I'm using some #{value}"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### After

```elixir
def my_component(assign) do
  temple do
    c &my_component/1 do
      slot :a_slot, let: %{some: value} do
        "I'm using some #{value}"
      end
    end
  end
end
```
