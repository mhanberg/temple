> You are looking at the README for the main branch. The README for the latest stable release is located [here](https://github.com/mhanberg/temple/tree/v0.9.0).

Temple is an Elixir DSL for writing HTML and SVG.

## Installation

Add `temple` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:temple, "~> 0.9.0-rc.0"}
  ]
end
```
## Goals

Currently Temple has the following things on which it won't compromise.

- Will only work with valid Elixir syntax.
- Should work in all web environments such as Plug, Aino, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView.

## Usage

Using Temple is as simple as using the DSL inside of an `temple/1` block. The runtime result of the macro is your HTML.

See the [guides](https://hexdocs.pm/temple/your-first-template.html) for more details.

```elixir
import Temple

temple do
  h2 do: "todos"

  ul class: "list" do
    for item <- @items do
      li class: "item" do
        div class: "checkbox" do
          div class: "bullet hidden"
        end

        div do: item
      end
    end
  end

  script do: """
  function toggleCheck({currentTarget}) {
    currentTarget.children[0].children[0].classList.toggle("hidden");
  }

  let items = document.querySelectorAll("li");

  Array.from(items).forEach(checkbox => checkbox.addEventListener("click", toggleCheck));
  """
end
```

### Components

Temple components are simple to write and easy to use.

Unlike normal partials, Temple components have the concept of "slots", which are similar [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-slots.html#named-slots). You can also refer to HEEx and Surface for examples of templates that have the "slot" concept.

Please see the [guides](https://hexdocs.pm/temple/components.html) for more details.

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Component do
  import Temple

  def card(assigns) do
    temple do
      section do
        div do
          slot :header
        end

        div do
          slot :default
        end

        div do
          slot :footer
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Using components is as simple as passing a reference to your component function to the `c` keyword.

```elixir
import MyAppWeb.Component

c &card/1 do
  slot :header do
    @user.full_name
  end

  @user.bio

  slot :footer do
    a href: "https://twitter.com/#{@user.twitter}" do
      "@#{@user.twitter}"
    end
    a href: "https://github.com/#{@user.github}" do
      "@#{@user.github}"
    end
  end
end
```

### Engine

By default, Temple will use the `EEx.SmartEngine` that is built into the Elixir standard library. If you are a web framework that uses it's own template engine (such as [Aino](https://github.com/oestrich/aino) and Phoenix/LiveView, you can configure Temple to it!

```elixir
# config/config.exs

config :temple,
  engine: Aino.View.Engine # or Phoenix.HTML.Engine or Phoenix.LiveView.Engine
```

### Formatter

To include Temple's formatter configuration, add `:temple` to your `.formatter.exs`.

```elixir
[
  import_deps: [:temple],
  inputs: ["*.{ex,exs}", "priv/*/seeds.exs", "{config,lib,test}/**/*.{ex,exs,lexs}"],
]
```

## Phoenix

To use with [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix), please use the [temple_phoenix](https://github.com/mhanberg/temple_phoenix) package! This bundles up some useful helpers as well as the Phoenix Template engine.
